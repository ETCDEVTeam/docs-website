ETCDEV Documentation website generator
======================================


Based on Gitbook, downloads all projects in local directory (`_sources`) and call Gitbook geenrator for each of 
them, putting result to `_target`. In addition to that generates home page for the websites.

# Configuration

```
# Whitelist projects
declare -a projects=(
        ETCDEVTeam/emerald-cli
        ETCDEVTeam/emerald-js
        #ethereumproject/go-ethereum
        #whilei/go-ethereum # just for dev purposes
)
```

Edit `website/data.json` to specify details of the project to put into home page.
